__init__()	                        Create and initialize all instance variables to None

validate_flower()	                Return true, if flower name is valid. Else, return false
                                     (Refer table for valid flower names)

setter methods	                    Include setter methods for all instance variables to set its values
getter methods	                    Include getter methods for all instance variables to get its values
 
 
Flower Name	  Level(in Kgs)
Orchid	        15
Rose	        25
Jasmine	        40
Note: Perform case insensitive string comparison
Represent few flowers, initialize instance variables using setter methods, invoke appropriate methods and test your program.
